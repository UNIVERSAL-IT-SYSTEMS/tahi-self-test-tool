  1. TN transmits an Echo Request that hs a Fragment header with a Fragment Offset of 0 and the More Fragments flag clear.
  2. Observe the packets transmitted by the NUT.

  Echo Request Data (original) is:

        IPv6 Header
            Version            = 6
            Traffic Class      = 0
            FlowLabel          = 0
            PayloadLength      = 15
            NextHeader         = 58 (ICMPv6)
            SourceAddress      = TN Link Local Address
            DestinationAddress = NUT Link Local Address

        ICMP Echo Request
            Type           = 128 (Echo Request)
            Code           = 0
            Checksum       = (auto)
            Identifier     = (auto)
            SequenceNumber = 0
            PayloadData    = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}

  Echo Request Data (Offset 0, MFlag 0) is:

        IPv6 Header
            Version            = 6
            Traffic Class      = 0
            FlowLabel          = 0
            PayloadLength      = 24
            NextHeader         = 44 (Fragment Header)
            SourceAddress      = TN Link Local Address
            DestinationAddress = NUT Link Local Address

        Fragment Header
            NextHeader         = 58 (ICMPv6)
            FragmentOffset     = 0
            MFlag              = 0
            Identification     = 32bit (Automatic generation)

        Payload
            data               = 16 octets from the head of ICMP Echo request


=head1 JUDGEMENT

  PASS: The NUT must transmit an Echo Reply to TN1. The Echo Reply must not include a Fragment header.

        IPv6 Header
            Version             = 6
            Traffic Class       = 0
            FlowLabel           = 0
            PayloadLength       = 16
            NextHeader          = 58 (ICMPv6)
            SourceAddress       = NUT Link Local Address
            Destination Address = TN Link Local Address

        ICMP Echo Reply
            Type           = 129 (Echo Reply)
            Code           = 0
            Checksum       = (auto)
            Identifier     = (same as Echo Request)
            SequenceNumber = (same as Echo Request)
            PayloadData    = (same as Echo Request)

#   
# 4.5  Fragment Header
# 
#    Each fragment packet is composed of:
# 
#       (1) The Unfragmentable Part of the original packet, with the  
#           Payload Length of the original IPv6 header changed to contain
#           the length of this fragment packet only (excluding the length
#           of the IPv6 header itself), and the Next Header field of the
#           last header of the Unfragmentable Part changed to 44.
# 
# =begin html
# <PRE>
#       <B>(2) A Fragment header containing:
# <BR>
#                The Next Header value that identifies the first header of
#                the Fragmentable Part of the original packet.
# <BR>
#                A Fragment Offset containing the offset of the fragment, 
#                in 8-octet units, relative to the start of the
#                Fragmentable Part of the original packet.  The Fragment
#                Offset of the first ("leftmost") fragment is 0.
# <BR>
#                An M flag value of 0 if the fragment is the last 
#                ("rightmost") one, else an M flag value of 1.
# <BR>
#                The Identification value generated for the original   
#                packet.</B>
# </PRE>
# 
# =end html
# 
#       (3) The fragment itself.
# 
#    The lengths of the fragments must be chosen such that the resulting
#    fragment packets fit within the MTU of the path to the packets'
#    destination(s).
# 
#    At the destination, fragment packets are reassembled into their
#    original, unfragmented form, as illustrated:
# 
#    reassembled original packet:
# 
#    +------------------+----------------------//------------------------+
#    |  Unfragmentable  | 2-bit reserved fFragmentablealized to zero for |
#    |       Part       | transmission; ignorePart                       |
#    +------------------+----------------------//------------------------+
#   
#    The following rules govern reassembly:
#   
#       An original packet is reassembled only from fragment packets that
#       have the same Source Address, Destination Address, and Fragment
#       Identification.
#   
#       The Unfragmentable Part of the reassembled packet consists of all
#       headers up to, but not including, the Fragment header of the first
#       fragment packet (that is, the packet whose Fragment Offset is
#       zero), with the following two changes:
#   
#          The Next Header field of the last header of the Unfragmentable
#          Part is obtained from the Next Header field of the first
#          fragment's Fragment header.
# 
#          The Payload Length of the reassembled packet is computed from
#          the length of the Unfragmentable Part and the length and offset
#          of the last fragment.  For example, a formula for computing the
#          Payload Length of the reassembled original packet is:
# 
#            PL.orig = PL.first - FL.first - 8 + (8 * FO.last) + FL.last
# 
#            where
#            PL.orig  = Payload Length field of reassembled packet.
#            PL.first = Payload Length field of first fragment packet.
#            FL.first = length of fragment following Fragment header of
#                       first fragment packet.
#            FO.last  = Fragment Offset field of Fragment header of
#                       last fragment packet.
#            FL.last  = length of fragment following Fragment header of
#                       last fragment packet.
# 
#       The Fragmentable Part of the reassembled packet is constructed
#       from the fragments following the Fragment headers in each of the
#       fragment packets.  The length of each fragment is computed by
#       subtracting from the packet's Payload Length the length of the
#       headers between the IPv6 header and fragment itself; its relative
#       position in Fragmentable Part is computed from its Fragment Offset
#       value.
# 
#       The Fragment header is not present in the final, reassembled
#       packet.
