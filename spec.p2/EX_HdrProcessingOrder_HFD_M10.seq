=head1 TEST PROCEDURE

Verify that a node properly processes the headers of an IPv6 packet in the correct order.

   TN                          NUT
    |                           |
    |-------------------------->|
    |   Test Packet             |
    |                           |
    |                           |
    |<--------------------------|
    |   ICMP Error              |
    |                           |
    v                           v

  1. TN transmits Test Packet, an Echo Request that has a Hop-by-Hop Options header, 
     Fragment header, and Destination Options header in that order.
     The IPv6 header has a Payload Length that is not a multiple of 8 octets, 
     and the Fragment header has the M-bit set.
     The Destination Options header has an unknown Option Type 135.
  2. Observe the packets transmitted by the NUT.

  Test Packet Data is:

        IPv6 Header
            Version            = 6
            Traffic Class      = 0
            FlowLabel          = 0
            PayloadLength      = 37
            NextHeader         = 0 (Hop-by-Hop Options Header)
            SourceAddress      = TN Link Local Address
            DestinationAddress = NUT Link Local Address

        Hop-by-Hop Options Header
            NextHeader         = 44 (Fragment Header)
            HeaderExtLength    = 0
            OptionType         = 1 (PadN)
            OptDataLength      = 4
            pad                = {0, 0, 0, 0}

        Fragment Header
            NextHeader         = 60 (Destination Header)
            FragmentOffset     = 0
            MFlag              = 1
            FragmentID         = 103

        Destination Header
            NextHeader         = 58 (ICMPv6)
            HeaderExtLength    = 0
            OptionType         = 0x87 (unknown, msb:10)
            OptDataLength      = 4
            data               = {0, 0, 0, 0}

        ICMP Echo Request
            Type           = 128 (Echo Request)
            Code           = 0
            Checksum       = (auto)
            Identifier     = 0xffff
            SequenceNumber = 1
            PayloadData    = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

=head1 JUDGEMENT

  PASS: The NUT should send an ICMPv6 Parameter Problem message to TN.
        The Code field must be 0(erroneous header field encountered).
        The Pointer field should be 0x04(offset of Payload Length field in the IPv6 header).
        The NUT must discard the Echo Request from TN.

        IPv6 Header
            Version             = 6
            Traffic Class       = 0
            FlowLabel           = 0
            PayloadLength       = 85
            NextHeader          = 58 (ICMPv6)
            SourceAddress       = Target Link Local Address
            Destination Address = Tester Link Local Address

        ICMP Error
            Type           = 4 (Parameter Problem)
            Code           = 0 (erroneous header field encountered)
            Checksum       = (auto)
            Pointer        = 4 (Payload Length field in IPv6 Header)
            PayloadData    = (Sent Packet)

=head1 CLEANUP

Common Test Cleanup

# =head1 REFERENCE
# 
# RFC2460
# 
# 4.1  Extension Header Order
# 
#    When more than one extension header is used in the same packet, it is
#    recommended that those headers appear in the following order:
# 
#            IPv6 header
#            Hop-by-Hop Options header
#            Destination Options header (note 1)
#            Routing header
#            Fragment header
#            Authentication header (note 2)
#            Encapsulating Security Payload header (note 2)
#            Destination Options header (note 3)
#            upper-layer header
# 
#            note 1: for options to be processed by the first destination
#                    that appears in the IPv6 Destination Address field
#                    plus subsequent destinations listed in the Routing
#                    header.
# 
#            note 2: additional recommendations regarding the relative
#                    order of the Authentication and Encapsulating
#                    Security Payload headers are given in [RFC-2406].
# 
#            note 3: for options to be processed only by the final
#                    destination of the packet.
# 
# 4.5  Fragment Header
# 
#       If the length of a fragment, as derived from the fragment packet's
#       Payload Length field, is not a multiple of 8 octets and the M flag
#       of that fragment is 1, then that fragment must be discarded and an
#       ICMP Parameter Problem, Code 0, message should be sent to the
#       source of the fragment, pointing to the Payload Length field of
#       the fragment packet.
