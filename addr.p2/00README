* First of all

	This is a set of conformance tests for IPv6 Stateless Address
	Autoconfiguration that is based upon RFC2462 and RFC2461.

* Test coverage

	The test coverage is the followings:

					
                                     | the NUT type            |
                                     +-------------------------+
  Category                           | host       | router     | comments
 ------------------------------------+------------+------------+----------------
 1.DAD                                                           
   Stateless Address Configuration    done          done
   Manual Address Configuration       almost done   almost done  (*1)
 2.Creation of Global and Site-local
     address
   Router Advertisement Processing    done          N/A          (*2)
   Address Lifetime Expiry            done          N/A         
 3.Surprise                           half done     half done    (*3)
 ------------------------------------+------------+------------+----------------
   (*1) new test set does not supoprt manual address configuration yet.
	to run this test, please use legacy test.
	for more detail of legacy test, see Lower Compatibility section.
   (*2) except 
         stateful address configuration (M,O flag)
         ValidLifetime over 2H
         PrefixOption with AH

   (*3) only legacy tests support


* How to configuration(if required)
	You can configure some parameters to adopt your target device.
	Please see config.pl.
	You would find some adjustable parameters.
	Changing these parameters is acceptable even for IPv6 Ready Logo.


* How to run the tests

	# vi /usr/local/v6eval/etc/tn.def
	# vi /usr/local/v6eval/etc/nut.def
	% cp -Rp /usr/local/v6eval/ct $SOMEWHERE
	% cd $SOMEWHERE
	% make test
	% netscape index.html

	If you know more about it,
	please see /usr/local/v6eval/doc/INSTALL.ct.


* Lower Compatibility
	In ct-2.1.1 stateless address autoconfiguration tests are swapped by
	newer test.
	If you want to run newer tests, please type following command line.
		% make test
		or
		% make tahi

	If you want to run older tests, please type following command line.
		% make legacy-test
		or
		% make legacy-tahi

	From ct-2.1.1 the older tests(for legacy-test or legacy-tahi)
	are out of support.
	So we recommend using newer tests.
	Please use following command.
		% make test
		or
		% make tahi
