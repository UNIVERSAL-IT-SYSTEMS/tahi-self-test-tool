=head1 NAME

  Test v6LC.2.1.2 - Resolution Wait Queue
  Part A: Single Queue

=head1 Purpose

  Verify that a node properly queues packets while waiting for address resolution of the next hop.

=head1 References

  * [ND] Section 3, Section 7.2.2

=head1 Resource Requirements

  * Packet generator
  * Monitor to capture packets

=head1 Test Setup

  No Common Test Setup is performed. The Common Test Cleanup procedure is

=head1 Procedure

  Part A: Single Queue
   1. TN1 transmits Packet A, an Echo Request, 3 times. The Sequence number is incremented each
      time.
   2. Observe the packets transmitted by the NUT.
   3. TN1 transmits the Neighbor Advertisement C in response to any Neighbor Solicitations from the
      NUT.
   4. Observe the packets transmitted by the NUT.

=head1 Observable Results

  Part A
   Step 2:
   The NUT should transmit a Neighbor Solicitation with a Target Address equal to
   TN1's link-local address. The NUT should send Echo Replies to TN1 in response to Packet
   A.

   Step 4:
   The Echo Replies should correspond to the last 3 Echo Requests sent by TN1 to 
   the NUT, indicating successful queuing of packets while waiting for address resolution
   to complete. The number of Echo Replies MUST be no less than 1.


=head1 Possible Problems

  * None.
