=head1 Test Setup

  No Common Test Setup is performed. Wait at least 3 seconds
  (MAX_MULTICAST_SOLICIT * RETRANS_TIMER) after any previous cleanup to make sure all
  previous NCE's are in state No NCE. The Common Test Cleanup procedure is performed after each part.

=head1 Procedure

   1. TN1 transmits Echo Request A to the NUT.
   2. TN1 transmits Neighbor Advertisement Q to the NUT.
   3. Check the NCE of TN1 on the NUT and observe the packets transmitted by the NUT.
   4. Wait (DELAY_FIRST_PROBE_TIME) seconds.
   5. Check the NCE of TN1 on the NUT and observe the packets transmitted by the NUT.
   6. TN1 transmits Neighbor Advertisement A. The Solicited and Override flags are set according to
       Part A entry of the table in the discussion above. Similarly, the address in the Target Link Layer
       Address Option is provided as it is indicated.
   7. Skip this step for Parts A, B, E, F, I, K, M, N, O, Q and R; TN1 transmits an Echo Request.
   8. Check the NCE of TN1 on the NUT and observe the packets transmitted by the NUT.
   9. Perform the common cleanup procedure.
  10. Repeat Steps 1 through 9 for Parts B through R.

=head1 Observable Results

  Parts A through R
   Step 3:
   The NUT should change the state of TN1's NCE to STALE. After receiving the
   Echo Request from TN1, the NUT should send a Reply and enter state DELAY.

   Step 5:
   The NUT should change the state of TN1's NCE to PROBE by transmitting a unicast
   Neighbor Solicitation to TN1.

   Step 8:
   The NUT MUST update the state of TN1's NCE and the LLA according to the table
   in the discussion above. After receiving the Echo Request from TN1 in step 7, the NUT
   should react according to the following:
