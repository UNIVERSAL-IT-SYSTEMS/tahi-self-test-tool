=head1 Test Setup

   No Common Test Setup is performed. Wait at least 3 seconds
  (MAX_MULTICAST_SOLICIT * RETRANS_TIMER) after any previous cleanup to make sure all
  previous NCE's are in state No NCE. The Common Test Cleanup procedure is performed after each part.

=head1 Procedure

  Part E: Receiving NA without Target Link-Layer Address Option
   21. TN1 transmits Packet A.
   22. Observe the packets transmitted by the NUT.
   23. TN1 transmits a Neighbor Advertisement without any Target Link-Layer Address Option.
   24. Observe the packets transmitted by the NUT and the NCE of TN1 on the NUT.

=head1 Observable Results

  Part E

   Step 22:
   After receiving the Echo Request from TN1, the NUT should create a Neighbor
   Cache Entry for TN1 and set the state of the Entry to INCOMPLETE. The NUT should
   send a multicast Neighbor Solicitation to TN1.

   Step 24:
   The NUT should ignore the NA transmitted by TN1. There should be no change in
   the neighbor cache for TN1 as it should stay in state INCOMPLETE. The NUT should
   continue to send multicast Neighbor Solicitation to TN1.

=head1 Possible Problems

  * None.
